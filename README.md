# 🌸 Flower Recognition Project 🌼

This project aims to classify flower images into different categories using deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition).
---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of images of various flowers, including daisies, sunflowers, tulips, roses, and dandelions. Each image is labeled with its corresponding flower type.
---

## 🛠️ Model Development

The project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) implemented using the Keras library in TensorFlow. The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip are applied to improve model generalization.
